# Event Lottery System Application

A mobile app for fair and accessible event registration using a lottery system. Entrants join waiting lists, and organizers randomly select participants. Features include QR code event access, Firebase integration, notifications, image uploads, and role-based interactions for entrants, organizers, and admins.

## Features
- Lottery-based selection system
- QR code event access

- Notifications for entrants
- Image upload for event posters
- Multi-user roles: entrant, organizer, admin

## Roles
**Entrant** – Join or leave event waiting lists, view events, receive lottery notifications, manage profile.  
**Organizer** – Create and manage events, draw participants, send notifications, upload event posters.  
**Admin** – Manage and remove events, profiles, and images.
